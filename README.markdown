mws-rb
========

## Before Staring
For some weird reason, the gem only works on ruby 1.9.3-p237 and 1.9.3-p392, I'm working to fix it. Just a warning for now.

## What?
mws-rb is a complete wrapper for Amazon.com's Marketplace Web Service (MWS) API. It exposes the entire MWS api in a more friendly way.

## How?

#### Installation

Using with a Gemfile (mostly rails projects):

    gem 'mws-rb'
    bundle install

Using in a simple ruby file:

    gem install mws-rb
    require 'mws-rb'

#### Initialization

    mws_api = MWS.new(
      host: "mws-eu.amazonservices.com",
      aws_access_key_id: "Your access key id",
      aws_secret_access_key: "Your secret access key",
      seller_id: "Your seller/merchant id"
    )

#### Using

To access the apis you can use:

        mws_api._api_name_.call(:action_to_be_called, params={})

The :call method exposes the API receiving an action_name and a hash of params.

All MWS apis are covered in this gem:

        mws_api.feeds.call(:action_to_be_called, params={})
        mws_api.orders.call(:action_to_be_called, params={})
        mws_api.reports.call(:action_to_be_called, params={})
        mws_api.products.call(:action_to_be_called, params={})
        mws_api.sellers.call(:action_to_be_called, params={})
        mws_api.recommendations.call(:action_to_be_called, params={})
        mws_api.fulfillment_inventory.call(:action_to_be_called, params={})
        mws_api.fulfillment_inbound_shipment.call(:action_to_be_called, params={})
        mws_api.fulfillment_outbound_shipment.call(:action_to_be_called, params={})

#### API docs/actions/params

You can check on the MWS documentation section all actions and params needed:

- http://docs.developer.amazonservices.com/en_US/feeds/index.html
- http://docs.developer.amazonservices.com/en_US/reports/index.html
- http://docs.developer.amazonservices.com/en_US/fba_inbound/index.html
- http://docs.developer.amazonservices.com/en_US/fba_inventory/index.html
- http://docs.developer.amazonservices.com/en_US/fba_outbound/index.html
- http://docs.developer.amazonservices.com/en_US/orders/index.html
- http://docs.developer.amazonservices.com/en_US/products/index.html
- http://docs.developer.amazonservices.com/en_US/recommendations/index.html
- http://docs.developer.amazonservices.com/en_US/sellers/index.html

#### Example

Let's say we want to retrieve a list of orders using MWS orders api:

    mws_api.orders.call(
      :list_orders,
      "MarketplaceId.Id.1" => "marketplace id",
      created_after: Time.new(2013, 1, 1)
    )

#### Testing your keys

Some MWS sections has a "GetServiceStatus" action that can be called without params to retrieve the api status. You can use this action to test your keys.

    mws_api.products.call(:get_service_status)
    => "GetServiceStatusResult"=>{"Status"=>"GREEN", "Timestamp"=>"2013-07-09T10:34:06.674Z"}

## TODO

- Create a better way to use the feeds api, add helpers so the user can easily create the desired xml.
- Use method_missing to allow calls direct to the api action, e.g: mws_api.orders.list_orders(params).
- Parse structured list params
- Complete documentation.
